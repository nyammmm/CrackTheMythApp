Half-lives can range from fractions of a second to billions of years. This process is predictable and crucial for dating artifacts and safely managing nuclear waste. The amount of material remaining after $n$ half-lives can be calculated using the formula: $N(t) = N_0(1/2)^{n}$. This decay process is the key to understanding why high-level nuclear waste eventually becomes less radioactive than the original uranium ore, albeit over a very long time. The half-life concept is vital in nuclear physics, determining the practical lifespan of isotopes used in medicine (which require short half-lives for patient safety) and calculating the necessary storage time for long-lived waste. The predictability of this decay is what allows scientists to reliably calculate long-term safety requirements for nuclear waste repositories, assuring public safety over geological timescales. The rate is fundamentally a property of the isotope and is unaffected by external factors like temperature, pressure, or chemical state. This is a robust and immutable law of physics.",
